## Chapter 3 Digital Logic Structure

### The Transistor

MOS: metal-oxide-semiconductor

P-type and N-type operate logically,very similar to the way wall switches work

#### A circuit Consist

* Power supply
* A wall switch
* lamp

#### N-type and P-type MOS transistor

##### Three Termials:

* Gate
* Source
* Drain

##### N-type of Transistor:

* gate is supplied with 1.2V
  * The connection from the source to the Drain acts like a piece of wire
  * We have a short circuit between the source and drain
* gate is supplied with 0V
  * The transistor acts like an open circuit

##### Not show complete circuit, we only show the termial of power supply

##### P type transistor

Oppisite fashion from the N-type transistor



## Chapter 5 LC-3

### Overview

#### Memory Organization

address space: $2^16$

Addressability: 16 bits

a word: 16 bits

LC-3 is word-addressable

#### register

Geeral purpose register(GPR)

16 bits each register

Identified by R0 to R7,register file

#### The instruction set

##### Opcode
